This the blog of Todd Olsen. I've spent the last decade or so working with kids, mostly high school age, teaching them a variety of subjects, from English literature to advanced math to Latin to US History. Programming has been a hobby of mine from a very young age. Lately I'm focused on Objective-C and Swift.
