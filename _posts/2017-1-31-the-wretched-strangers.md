<pre class="poetry">
Grant them removed, and grant that this your noise</br>
Hath chid down all the majesty of England;</br>
Imagine that you see the wretched strangers,</br>
Their babies at their backs and their poor luggage,</br>
Plodding to th’ ports and coasts for transportation,</br>
And that you sit as kings in your desires,</br>
Authority quite silent by your brawl,</br>
And you in ruff of your opinions clothed;</br>
What had you got? I’ll tell you. You had taught</br>
How insolence and strong hand should prevail,</br>
How order should be quelled; and by this pattern</br>
Not one of you should live an aged man,</br>
For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought,</br>
With self same hand, self reasons, and self right,</br>
Would shark on you, and men like ravenous fishes</br>
Would feed on one another.</br>
</br>
                                      O, desperate as you are,</br>
Wash your foul minds with tears, and those same hands,</br>
That you like rebels lift against the peace,</br>
Lift up for peace, and your unreverent knees,</br>
Make them your feet to kneel to be forgiven!</br>
</br>
                                      You’ll put down strangers,</br>
Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses,</br>
And lead the majesty of law in line,</br>
To slip him like a hound. Say now the king</br>
(As he is clement, if th’ offender mourn)</br>
Should so much come to short of your great trespass</br>
As but to banish you, whether would you go?</br>
What country, by the nature of your error,</br>
Should give you harbor? Go you to France or Flanders,</br>
To any German province, to Spain or Portugal,</br>
Nay, any where that not adheres to England,—</br>
Why, you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased</br>
To find a nation of such barbarous temper,</br>
That, breaking out in hideous violence,</br>
Would not afford you an abode on earth,</br>
Whet their detested knives against your throats,</br>
Spurn you like dogs, and like as if that God</br>
Owed not nor made not you, nor that the claimants</br>
Were not all appropriate to your comforts,</br>
But chartered unto them, what would you think</br>
To be thus used? This is the strangers’ case;</br>
And this your mountanish inhumanity.</pre>
