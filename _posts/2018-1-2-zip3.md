title: "Zip 3"
summary: "An implementation of a free <code>zip</code> function that will take three <code>Sequence</code> types and return another <code>Sequence</code> whose elements are each three-item tuples built from the elements of three underlying sequences. It's the <code>zip</code> from the standard library but for three sequences."

In the Swift Standard Library, you'll find a convenient free function called <a href='https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1541125-zip'>`zip`</a> which will interlace any two sequences you give it.

{% highlight swift %}
let seq1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let seq2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

let result = zip(seq1, seq2)
result.forEach { print($0) }
{% endhighlight %}

This print out:

{% highlight swift %}
(1, "a")
(2, "b")
(3, "c")
(4, "d")
(5, "e")
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes though, you need to interlace *three* sequences. Behold! **[Zip3][0]**, an implementation closely patterned on the Standard Library's [implementation of `zip`][1]: formatting, naming conventions, etc.

The function itself is extremely short. It just takes three sequences of possibly three separate types and returns some type that is generic over those same three sequence types. We will overload the Standard Library's `zip` function and the third parameter will differentiate this implementation so the compiler will know which to use.

{% highlight swift %}
func zip<Sequence1, Sequence2, Sequence3>(
    _ sequence1: Sequence1, _ sequence2: Sequence2, _ sequence3: Sequence3
    ) -> Zip3Sequence<Sequence1, Sequence2, Sequence3> {
    return Zip3Sequence(sequence1, sequence2, sequence3)
}
{% endhighlight %}

One admirable trait of the Standard Library's implementation is the way it breaks its task into most dirt simple parts. The return type of the `zip` function is a `Zip3Sequence` struct. It is initialized with the three sequences which are stored as properties. Consequently the types of these three sequences are associated with the aliases `Sequence1`, `Sequence2`, and `Sequence3`.

{% highlight swift %}
struct Zip3Sequence<Sequence1: Sequence, Sequence2: Sequence, Sequence3: Sequence> {
    let _sequence1: Sequence1
    let _sequence2: Sequence2
    let _sequence3: Sequence3
    init(_ sequence1: Sequence1, _ sequence2: Sequence2, _ sequence3: Sequence3) {
        (_sequence1, _sequence2, _sequence3) = (sequence1, sequence2, sequence3)
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Eventually, we want `Zip3Sequence` to conform to `Sequence`. As a prerequisite, it needs to define a type conforming to `IteratorProtocol` that it will use as the return type of the `makeIterator` function. We'll nest this definition within the `Zip3Sequence` itself since it is specific to that type.

{% highlight swift %}
extension Zip3Sequence {
    struct Iterator {
        var _baseStream1: Sequence1.Iterator
        var _baseStream2: Sequence2.Iterator
        var _baseStream3: Sequence3.Iterator
        var _reachedEnd: Bool = false
        init(
            _ iterator1: Sequence1.Iterator,
            _ iterator2: Sequence2.Iterator,
            _ iterator3: Sequence3.Iterator
        ) {
            (_baseStream1, _baseStream2, _baseStream3) = (iterator1, iterator2, iterator3)
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

This `Iterator` struct holds the three iterators created by the three sequences of the `Zip3Sequence` respectively and a flag indicating whether the iterator should at last return `nil`.

Of course `Zip3Sequence.Iterator` does not yet conform to `IteratorProtocol`. It must implement the `next() -> Element?` function. This can be done within an extension on `Zip3Sequence.Iterator`.

{% highlight swift %}
extension Zip3Sequence.Iterator: IteratorProtocol {
    public typealias Element = (Sequence1.Element, Sequence2.Element, Sequence3.Element)
    public mutating func next() -> Element? {
        if _reachedEnd {
            return nil
        }
        guard let element1 = _baseStream1.next(),
              let element2 = _baseStream2.next(),
              let element3 = _baseStream3.next() else {
            _reachedEnd = true
            return nil
        }
        return (element1, element2, element3)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The return type of `next()` is an optional `Element` which is a tuple of the `Element` types of the three underlying sequence iterators. This the type that each successive iteration of the sequence will yield, a three-part tuple of the three corresponding elements from the three underlying sequences. As long as all three return elements, the sequence continues. Once any one of them returns nil, the whole sequence ends. That's all that is needed for `Zip3Sequence.Iterator` to conform to `IteratorProtocol`. Now that it does, `Zip3Sequence` can finally conform to `Sequence`.

{% highlight swift %}
extension Zip3Sequence: Sequence {
    typealias Element = (Sequence1.Element, Sequence2.Element, Sequence3.Element)
    func makeIterator() -> Iterator {
        return Iterator(
            _sequence1.makeIterator(),
            _sequence2.makeIterator(),
            _sequence3.makeIterator()
        )
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

All `Zip3Sequence` needs to do is implement `makeIterator()` which will create an iterator of the type it just defined and return it. The iterator is initialized with freshly created iterators from the three underlying sequences.

{% highlight swift %}
let seq1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let seq2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
let seq3 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

let result = zip(seq1, seq2, seq3)
result.forEach { print($0) }

/*
 (1, 2, 10)
 (2, 4, 20)
 (3, 6, 30)
 (4, 8, 40)
 (5, 10, 50)
 */
{% endhighlight %}

The code for zip3 is [available a gist][2]. Enjoy!
