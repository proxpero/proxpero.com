title: Hilbert Curves, part 1: Translating C into Swift
summary: "C and Swift both try to be simple languages, but they have different ideas about what it means to be simple. In this post, I take a simple C program to calculate Hilbert curves and translate it into idiomatic Swift."

Like many other fractals, the [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) is beautiful. I won't try to define it here but I'll point you to these great youtube explainers:
- 3Blue1Brown: [Hilbert's Curve, and the usefulness of infinite results in a finite world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuiryHHTrjU)
- Numberphile: [Space-filling Curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-DgL49CFlM)
- Vi Hart: [Squiggle Inception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik2CZqsAw28)
