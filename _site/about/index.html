    <p>Hi! My name is Todd Olsen. I teach reading, writing, and arithmetic to kids (as well as history, science, and Latin). This is where I (rarely) blog about software development (usually Swift on Apple platforms). Thanks for stopping in!</p>

<p>Here is a vague timeline of my personal programming history:</p>
<ul class="history">
  <li>My parents brought home my first computer, an Atari 800, as well as (in addition to many games) a cartridge for BASIC.</li>
  <li>My dad, "for work", brought home a great beige monstrosity. When you switched it on, a DOS prompt would appear and if you typed "win", then Windows would launch. When you switched it off, it would cut the power regardless of what you might have been doing. We had a few versions of this thing, one of which I took with me to college. I studied C and figured out how to look at the source code of a web page and made friends on the Tom Waits usenet newsgroup.</li>
  <li>After I started teaching, I downloaded Microsoft's Visual Studio and began to play. I wrote an desktop app to help me organize and format my teaching material so I wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel for every new student.</li>
  <li>During the year of Linux on the Desktop, I assembled a pc from parts and started dual booting Windows and Ubuntu. (I needed to maintain my app.)</li>
  <li>Driven to the brink of madness, I set the box on fire and purchased my first Mac. It was wonderful. I learned Cocoa and ported my app.</li>
  <li>One of the things I read on Joel Spolsky's blog was that I should read SICP. So I did. But I only did the exercises up through chapter two. Funnily enough, the things I best remember are from the first two chapters. Seriously, it is an amazing book. Well-written, well-organized.
  <li>My app was amazing. I literally needed to do zero preparation beforehand for any student, but I could still deliver targeted homework assignments on the spot. Automation, for the win!</li>
  <li>Another important book for me was Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms. I also watched the Coursera videos and I highly recommend them.
  <li>I stopped developing it specifically for my company and started trying to make it a more general purpose tool that perhaps all teachers might find useful. It is still a work in progress.</li>
</ul>
