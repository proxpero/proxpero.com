    <p>Hi! My name is Todd Olsen. I teach reading, writing, and arithmetic to kids (as well as history, science, and Latin). This is where I (rarely) blog about software development (usually Swift on Apple platforms). Thanks for stopping in!</p>

<p>Here is a vague timeline of my personal programming history:</p>

<h2 id="the-atari">The Atari</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/unloveable/2388501732/in/photolist-4D4Gmm-a4xs9t-9ExALD-JGiegp-xNBmbc-4ckqTt" title="Atari 400"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3005/2388501732_7819e995d3_z.jpg?zz&#x3D;1" width="640" height="481" alt="Atari 400" /></a></p>

<p>My parents brought home our first computer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family#The_early_machines:_400_and_800">an Atari 400</a>, membrane keyboard and everything. (Later, we eventually upgraded to the 800.) It seemed to me at the time that this device existed for my dad and me to play games on. We had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man">Pac Man</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">Missile Command</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)">Centipede</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_(video_game)">Joust</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Raiders">Star Raiders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert">Q*bert</a>, and probably others I can’t remember. To play, you hooked up a TV, popped open the hood above the keyboard and inserted the cartridge of the game you wanted to load. We also had a cassette tape peripheral we could use to load software.</p>

<p>Reading and writing bits to magnetic tape a few millimeters wide? It was not robust. But I naturally assumed that the computer was listening to music, and that’s what allowed it to know what to do.</p>

<h2 id="basic">Basic</h2>

<p>My dad dominated the high scores on all games, especially Pac Man. He wasn’t <a href="http://www.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/622-the-perfect-man">perfect</a>, but he was in a different league from me. However, I was the only one in family who played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_BASIC">BASIC</a>. My dad showed me this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-basic" data-lang="basic">10 PRINT "GOTO CONSIDERED AWESOME!"
20 GOTO 10</code></pre></figure>

<p>And if you ever went to a Sears in the local mall where they sold personal computers and saw a screen filled with a lewd statement, I may owe you an apology.</p>

<p>I remember a fat 3-ring binder of information related to BASIC programming with listings in the back that I typed into the computer, but the most important software eduction I received in these early days came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Adventure">the Micro Adventure books</a>, which I drank like water. The premise was that you were this elite hacker and as part of a small team you stopped evil thugs from destroying the world. When the plot called for a message to be decoded or a robot gun to be controlled, then you fired up your “micro” and typed in the program printed in the text, thus saving the day. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Adventure">Wikipedia</a> agrees that the programs were awesome. I was taught the thrill of getting a program working and the sometimes insuperable frustration involved in debugging.</p>

<h2 id="ibm-compatible">IBM Compatible</h2>

<p>My dad, “for work”, brought home a great big beige monstrosity. This was <a href="https://youtu.be/2B-XwPjn9YY?t=23">after the Mac</a> but before Windows became ubiquitous. When you switched it on, a DOS prompt would appear and from there you could launch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect#WordPerfect_for_DOS">Word Perfect</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3#DOS">Lotus 1-2-3</a>.</p>

<p>and if you typed “win”, then Windows would launch. When you switched it off, it would cut the power regardless of what you might have been doing. We had a few versions of this thing, one of which I took with me to college and made “internet friends” on the Tom Waits usenet newsgroup. At one point I took a C class.</p>

<p>After I started teaching, I downloaded Microsoft’s Visual Studio and began to play. I wrote an desktop app to help me organize and format my teaching material so I wouldn’t have to reinvent the wheel for every new student.</p>

<p>During the year of Linux on the Desktop, I assembled a pc from parts and started dual booting Windows and Ubuntu. (I needed to maintain my app.)</p>

<p>Driven to the brink of madness, I set the box on fire and purchased my first Mac. It was wonderful. I learned Cocoa and ported my app.</p>

<p>One of the things I read on Joel Spolsky’s blog was that I should read SICP. So I did. But I only did the exercises up through chapter two. Funnily enough, the things I best remember are from the first two chapters. Seriously, it is an amazing book. Well-written, well-organized.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought my app was amazing. I literally needed to do zero preparation beforehand for any student, but I could still deliver targeted homework assignments on the spot. Automation, for the win!</p>

<p>Another important book for me was Robert Sedgewick’s Algorithms. I also watched the Coursera videos and I highly recommend them.</p>

<p>I stopped developing it specifically for my company and started trying to make it a more general purpose tool that perhaps all teachers might find useful. It is still a work in progress. (Shipping is tough!)</p>
